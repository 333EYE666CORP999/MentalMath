# Introduction

This document provides resources to explore and understand the steps involved in adopting Swift 6.

# Rationale

Given the complexity of this topic, a central source of information is essential for effective comprehension.

# Documentation and Research Notes

## Glossary

- **Function value**: A reference (or pointer) to a function or closure.
- **Isolation domain**: A unit where shared mutable state is exclusively accessible, ensuring thread safety.
- **Sendable**: A protocol that types conform to in order to be passed safely across concurrency boundaries.
- **Actor**: A concurrency model in Swift where objects protect their state by serializing access to their properties and methods.
- **Suspension point**: A point where a function pauses execution, typically when awaiting an asynchronous task or switching between isolation domains.
- **Continuation:** a point of execution that can be postponed to be fired-up later. In Swift 6 this is like a closure-callbacks 2.0

## [Data Race Safety](https://www.swift.org/migration/documentation/swift-6-concurrency-migration-guide/dataracesafety/)

Swift 6 ensures data-isolation, guaranteeing mutually exclusive access to shared mutable states, verified at compile-time. Isolation can be:

- **Static**: Unaffected by runtime.
- **Dynamic**: Exposed during runtime.

### Isolation Domains

- **Non-isolated**:
  - Applies to global functions (e.g., func foo() {...}).
  - Applies to class definitions.

- **Isolated to an actor**:
  - Code inside an actor entity is isolated by default (including stored properties and functions).
  - Some functions or properties can be marked as non-isolated.
  - Global functions can accept isolated parameters, granting access to actor-isolated state.

- **Isolated to a global actor**:
  - For example, @MainActor isolates mutable state to a collective pool.
  - The nonisolated attribute on member symbols allows opting out of isolation.

### Isolation Inheritance

```swift
@MainActor 
class Animal {
	let name: String
	func eat(food: Pineapple) { }
}

class Chicken: Animal { } // Inherits MainActor isolation
```

In this example, Chicken inherits the isolation from its superclass Animal.

```swift
@MainActor 
protocol Feedable {
	func eat(food: Pineapple)
}

class Chicken: Feedable {} // Conforming type inherits isolation
```

In this protocol example, isolation applies to conforming types.

```swift
protocol Bull {
	@MainActor
	func moo()
}
```

Fine-grained isolation can be declared on individual methods or properties.

Once declared, isolation rules cannot be changed.

### Function Types

```swift
@MainActor
func eat(food: Pineapple) {
	Task {
		// Closure body inherits @MainActor isolation
		Chicken.static.eat(food)
	}

	Task { @MyGlobalActor in
		// Work with @MyGlobalActor here
	}
}
```


This example demonstrates how closures inherit isolation from the enclosing function.

### Crossing Isolation Boundaries

Crossing isolation boundaries involves moving values between isolation domains, done via async function calls or closures. Shared mutable state is never accessed concurrently during this process.

### Sendable Types

> See [Sendable Protocol](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/#Sendable) for more information on how Sendable works.

Types that conform to Sendable can safely be passed across isolation boundaries. Value types are Sendable by default if their stored properties are also Sendable, but this only applies within the same module. For external modules, explicit conformance to Sendable is required.

### Flow-Sensitive Isolation

In some cases, non-Sendable types can be used safely through region-based isolation (see [Region-Based Isolation](#region-based-isolation)).

### [Actor-Isolated Types](https://www.swift.org/migration/documentation/swift-6-concurrency-migration-guide/dataracesafety/#Actor-Isolated-Types)

All actor types are implicitly Sendable, as they guarantee serial, mutually exclusive access to their state. Global actor-isolated types (like @MainActor) have their members implicitly marked as Sendable.

### Reference Types and Sendability

To conform to Sendable, a reference type must:
- Contain no mutable state.
- Have immutable properties that are Sendable.
- Be marked final.

In certain cases, developers can use @unchecked Sendable to promise the compiler that a class is thread-safe, bypassing sendability checks. 

### Suspension Points

Tasks can switch isolation domains when a function in one domain calls a function in another. Cross-domain calls must be asynchronous to avoid blocking the receiverâ€™s mutable state. Suspension points are marked with await.

```swift
actor Fridge {
	var food = [Pineapple]()
	func stock(_ item: Pineapple) {
		food.append(item)
	}
}

@MainActor
func putToFridge() async {
	let food = Pineapple() // Main-actor-isolated context
	fridge.stock(food) // Switch to fridge's isolation domain
}
```

A task might not suspend even with await, as suspension depends on runtime conditions.

### Atomicity

Actors ensure mutual exclusivity, but atomicity is not guaranteed across suspension points.

swift
func deposit(pineapples: [Pineapple], onto island: Island) async { 
	var food = await island.food 
	food += pineapples 
	await island.store(food) 
}


In this example, the state can change between suspension points, making atomicity a concern.

## [Dynamic Isolation](https://www.swift.org/migration/documentation/swift-6-concurrency-migration-guide/incrementaladoption/#Dynamic-Isolation)

Dynamic isolation allows selective isolation, offering flexibility for concurrency. It means that a developer can specify what parts of code and how are isolated.

### Internal-Only Isolation

```swift
@MainActor class WindowStyler { ... } // entire class is isolated to MainActor

class WindowStyler {

	@MainActor // temp solution for migration
	private var colors: [Color]

	func applyStyle() {
		MainActor.assumeIsolated {
			// use to work with other state
		}
	}
}
```
### Usage-Only Isolation

```swift
@MainActor // we're already know this guy
class WindowStyler { ... }

class UIStyler {

	@MainActor // no need for UIStyler to be entirely isolated
	private var windowStyler: WindowStyler

	init...

	func applyStyle() {
		MainActor.assumeIsolated { 
			windowStyler.applyStype()
		}
	}
}
```
### Explicit Isolation

```swift
class NetworkProvider { ... }

await MainActor.run { // explicitly isolates w/o any inference
	let something = NetworkProvider().getSomething()
}
```


## [Actors](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/#Actors)

Actors in Swift 6 manage concurrency by isolating state and controlling access to shared mutable data.

## [Region-Based Isolation](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0414-region-based-isolation.md)

Region-based isolation offers fine-grained control over concurrent access to mutable state, which is particularly useful when isolation must be temporarily relaxed.

## [Defining and Calling Asynchronous Functions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/#Defining-and-Calling-Asynchronous-Functions)

Asynchronous functions in Swift 6 utilize await to handle concurrency efficiently. See the linked documentation for examples and detailed explanation.

### Types
#### Task

A Task represents a unit of concurrent work, executing only one function at a time. Tasks have an isolation domain, either set manually or inherited from the parent context. Tasks handle concurrency but cannot run asynchronously in the same isolation domain.

## [New Concurrency Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/#Actors)

### [New Life for Callback-based Functions - Continuations](https://www.swift.org/migration/documentation/swift-6-concurrency-migration-guide/incrementaladoption/#Wrapping-Callback-Based-Functions)

```swift
I

// how it were (original closure callback fashion, simplified)
func fetchData(from url: URL, completion: @escaping (Data?) -> Void) {
    URLSession.shared.dataTask(url) { data, response, error in
        guard
            error == nil,
            response.statusCode == 200,
            let data
        else {
            completion(nil)
            return
        }

        completion(data)
    }
}

// usage
{
... some context ...

	let url = URL(string: ...)
	fetchData(url) { data in
		guard let data else {
			// error handling appears only here
			return
		}

		// do stuff with data
	}

... some context ...
}

II

// what changed:
// - no callback now
// - func explicitly returns data (what callback covertly did)
// - no nil in callback, now transparent errors
func fetchData(from url: URL) async throws -> Data {
	try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
		API.fetchData(url) { data, error in
			if let error {
				continuation.resume(throwing: error) // explicit error
			} else if let data {
				continuation.resume(returning: data) // more clear data return
			} else {
				continuation.resume(throwing: NSError(...init code...))
			}
		}
	}
}

// usage
{
... some context ...

	let url = URL(string: ...)

	do {
		let data = try await fetchData(from: url)
	} catch let error {
		// do stuff with error
	}

... some context ...
}
